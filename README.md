#### The personal website for Alden Witt, "the best unsigned writer in Nashville."

_See this running at [aldenwitt.com][website]!_

This website uses Angular 2 with Typescript. It also makes use of my custom animation framework for 
sliding the different pages in and out of view.

## Getting up and running

The original app and build infrastructure are adapted from Minko Gechev's
[angular2-seed][seed-project] project. Refer to his project for help running this app.
